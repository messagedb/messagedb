### Welcome to the MessageDB configuration file

# Once every 24 hours MessageDB will report anonymous data to m.messagedb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false

### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the MessageDB cluster.

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for MessageDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]

  wal-partition-flush-delay = "2s" # The delay time between each WAL partition being flushed.

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]
  write-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a write operation must complete on the cluster.
  shard-writer-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a shard must respond to write.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = true

###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface.
###

[admin]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8080"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of MessageDB.
###

[http]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8075"
  max-connections = 5000

###
### [hinted-handoff]
###
### Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows nodes to temporarily
### store queued data when one node of a cluster is down for a short period
### of time.
###
